## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Based on the linear regression results, we can conclude that vehicle length and ground clearance are unlikely to provide a random amount of variance to mpg in the multiple linear regression model.
* The slope is not considered zero based on the estimated coefficients in the results. Vehicle Length has a coefficient of 6.267, and Ground Clearance has a coefficient of 3.546. Since these factors are the only ones with a signficiant impact on mpg, we would expect the slope to be non-zero.
* This model predicts effectively based on an R-squared value given near the bottom of the summary output (0.7149), which equates to an r-value of 0.8455, a strong correlation on the Pearson scale.
